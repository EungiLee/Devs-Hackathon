# Developers Society Hackathon - BenM - Meeting Planner Web-Application

Created by the team Benjamin Ma Technologies consisting of Natasha Ong, Eungi Lee, Logan Mellow, Lance Zhang

## What is it?

The BenM web-app addresses the lack of structure often found in Video Conferencing Calls that occurred during lockdown. BenM is intended to be used alongside video conferencing applications. Users collaboratively work on a meeting plan to organise which topics will be talked about, for how long and by who. It follows a flow chart style and users active participate in how they want the meeting to flow before and during the meeting.
